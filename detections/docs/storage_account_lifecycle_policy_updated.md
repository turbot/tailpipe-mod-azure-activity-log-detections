## Overview

Detect when a lifecycle management policy for an Azure Storage account was updated. Lifecycle policies automate data tiering, retention, and deletion, and unauthorized or unintended changes to these policies can lead to data loss, increased costs, or non-compliance with data retention requirements. Monitoring these updates ensures proper data management and adherence to organizational policies.
