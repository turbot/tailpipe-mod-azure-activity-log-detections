## Overview

Detect when an Azure Virtual Network (VNet) was created or updated. Virtual Networks are foundational for Azure resources, and changes to their configurations, such as address spaces, subnets, or peering settings, can impact connectivity and security. Monitoring these updates ensures consistent network operations and prevents unauthorized modifications.
