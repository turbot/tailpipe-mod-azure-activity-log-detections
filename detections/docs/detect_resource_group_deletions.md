## Overview

Detect deletions of Azure resource groups. Resource groups serve as logical containers for managing Azure resources, and their deletion can lead to the loss of all associated resources, potentially causing service disruptions and data loss. Monitoring these deletions helps ensure proper oversight and prevents accidental or unauthorized removal of critical resources.
